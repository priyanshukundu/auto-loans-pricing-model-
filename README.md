1. Objective
A Probability of Default (PD) model estimates the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan within a given time horizon.
Input: Borrower attributes (person_age, person_income, person_emp_length, etc.) and loan attributes (loan_int_rate, loan_amnt, loan_grade, etc.).
Output: A probability score between 0 and 1, e.g., a borrower might have a PD = 0.25, meaning a 25% chance of default.

2. Logical Steps in a PD Model
Step 1: Data Understanding
Identify target variable: loan_status (1 = default, 0 = no default).
Identify predictors/features:
Personal: person_age, person_income, person_home_ownership, person_emp_length, cb_person_default_on_file, cb_person_cred_hist_length.
Loan: loan_intent, loan_grade, loan_amnt, loan_int_rate, loan_percent_income.
Goal: Understand which features might indicate higher risk (e.g., low income, short employment length, high loan-to-income ratio).
Step 2: Feature Engineering
Numerical Features: Standardize or scale features like loan_amnt, loan_percent_income.
Categorical Features: Encode features like home_ownership, loan_intent, loan_grade into numerical forms.
Derived Features: Create new risk indicators, e.g.:
loan_amnt / person_income → debt burden ratio.
emp_length / age → stability index.
Purpose: Transform raw data into meaningful inputs that reflect risk.

Step 3: Model Selection
The goal is probabilistic prediction, so logistic regression is often the baseline because it naturally outputs probabilities.
More complex models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Output: PD score ∈ [0, 1] for each borrower.

Step 4: Model Training

Train the model on historical data (loan_status) to learn the relationship between features and default probability.
Model minimizes error in predicting defaults.

Evaluation Metrics:
AUC-ROC: Ability to distinguish defaulters vs. non-defaulters.
Brier Score: Measures accuracy of predicted probabilities.
KS Statistic: Common in credit risk for segmenting high-risk vs. low-risk borrowers.

Step 5: Calibration
Ensure the predicted probabilities match real-world default rates.
Example: If the model predicts PD = 0.2, approximately 20% of such borrowers should actually default.
Techniques: Platt scaling, isotonic regression, or quantile mapping.

Step 6: Risk Segmentation
Translate PD into risk grades for lending decisions:
Low Risk: PD < 0.05
Medium Risk: 0.05 ≤ PD < 0.2
High Risk: PD ≥ 0.2
This allows the bank to adjust loan pricing, approval, or credit limits.

Step 7: Monitoring & Updating
PD models degrade over time due to economic changes or new borrower behavior.
Regularly update with new data to maintain predictive accuracy.   changes need to be made .

3. Logical Flow Summary
Input borrower and loan data → 2. Feature engineering & risk indicators → 3. Train probabilistic classifier → 4. Output PD score → 5. Calibrate & segment into risk tiers → 6. Use for lending decisions & monitoring

💡 Key Intuition:
A PD model does not just classify “default” vs. “no default” — it estimates how likely a borrower is to default. This probability guides risk-adjusted decisions like interest rates or loan approvals.
